## How to use quickly?

1. Clone to your github.
2. Create a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account.
3. Link Netlify to your account.
4. Create a new site and link to the cloned repo.
5. Wait for Netlify to build your site.
6. Voila.

## Build and deploy locally

### Using docker?

``` bash
# build container
cd docker
docker-compose -p "dat_v1" up -d
# wait a little bit for it to build at the 1st time

# whenever working
docker start dat_local_v1
# NOTE: for the 1st run, it takes a little long time to build and serve
# You can check what are running on background with
docker attach dat_local_v1
```

### From scratch

__Note__: On Windows, you should [use WSL2](https://dinhanhthi.com/docker-wsl2-windows) to run Jekyll site.

After cloning to a local server, run these:

~~~
# install git

# install ruby
ruby --version

# install bundler
gem install bundler

# cd to the repo directory and install gems
bundle install

# run the server (http://localhost:4000)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# incremental build (only build the changes, faster)
bundle exec jekyll serve -I
~~~
